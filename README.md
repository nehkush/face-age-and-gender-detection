# face-age-and-gender-detection
Face age and gender detection typically involves:

1.Face Detection: Use OpenCV’s deep neural network (DNN) or Haar Cascades to locate faces.

2.Preprocessing: Convert the face into a blob (e.g., via cv2.dnn.blobFromImage), normalize, resize (commonly to 227×227), and subtract mean values.

3.Age & Gender Prediction: Pass the blob through pretrained models (often Caffe-based) to classify age into discrete ranges and gender as male/female

4.Visualization: Draw bounding boxes around faces and overlay predictions on the image or video frame
